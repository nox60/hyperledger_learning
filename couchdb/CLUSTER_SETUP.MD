CouchDB uses Erlang-native clustering functionality to achieve a clustered installation. Erlang uses TCP port 4369 (EPMD) to find other nodes, so all servers must be able to speak to each other on this port. In an Erlang cluster, all nodes are connected to all other nodes, in a mesh network configuration.
